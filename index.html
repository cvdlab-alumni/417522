         <h2>A Little Bit of History</h2>

        <p>Villa Cornaro is a patrician villa in Piombino Dese, about 30 km northwest of Venice, Italy. It was designed by the Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio in 1552 and is illustrated and described by him in Book Two of his 1570 masterwork, I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura [The Four Books on Architecture].</p>
        <p>


        <h3>Architectural Details</h3>
        <p>
        Villa Cornaro was substantially constructed in 1553-1554, with additional work into the 1590s, for Giorgio Cornaro, younger son of a wealthy Venetian family. It represents one of the most remarkable examples of a Renaissance villa. The north fa√ßade (illustrated) has an innovative projecting central portico-loggia that is a flexible living space out of the sun and open to cooling breezes. The interior space is a harmonious arrangement of the strictly symmetrical floor plans on which Palladio insisted without exception. Rooms of inter-related proportions composed of squares and rectangles flank a central axial vista which extends through the house. As Rudolph Wittkower noted, by moving subsidiary staircases into the projecting wings and filling matching corner spaces with paired oval principal stairs, space was left for a central salone which is fully as wide as the porticos (plan, left). The central core of the villa forms a rectangle in which there are six repetitions of an elegant standard module. The interior has 18th century frescos by Mattia Bortoloni and stuccos by Camillo Mariani.
        Through its illustration in Palladio's I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura, Villa Cornaro became a model for villas all over the world, particularly in England and in colonial America. Drayton Hall (1738-1742) in Charleston, South Carolina, and Thomas Jefferson's initial version of Monticello (1768-1770) are early examples of its influence in America.

        <h1> Introduction </h1>
        <p>
          Few documentation has been found but the aim of the project has been that of be as faithful as possible to the original villa.
          In particular there's been a lack of images of the side view of the villa, so this part of walls and fixtures

        <h1> Hierarchical Decomposition </h1>
        <p>
          The villa has been decomposed as follows:

           <p>
            MAIN STRUCTURE: <br/><br/>
          - Walls <br/>

          Theese are the first objects created.  <br/>
          The walls respect the original ratio (as shown in the pictures); <br/><br/>
